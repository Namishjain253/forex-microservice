Introduction
This project is a simple REST micro-service built using Spring Boot that communicates with an external API to fetch foreign exchange rates for USD from the European Central Bank. The fetched data is stored in a database and can be accessed through provided endpoints. The application only calls the external API when no data is available in the database.
